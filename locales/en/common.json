      "p1": "Based in Paris, I'm a <span class=\"font-semibold\">trilingual developer</span> (French, English, German) who began my career as a <span class=\"font-semibold\">language teacher</span> in academic and professional settings. My adventure into web development began in <span class=\"font-semibold\">2022</span>, where I started with the basics of <span class=\"font-semibold\">responsive design</span> and <span class=\"font-semibold\">DOM manipulation</span>, and quickly became <span class=\"underline\">hooked.</span> I loved seeing the fruits of my labour come to life on screen, and the <span class=\"font-semibold\">problem-solving aspect</span> quickly became my favorite part of programming. I <span class=\"underline\">love</span> the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a tricky issue.",

      "p2": "That passion led me to <span class=\"font-semibold\">change career paths entirely</span>. In <span class=\"font-semibold\">2023</span>, I began a <span class=\"font-semibold\">two-year work-study diploma</span> with OpenClassrooms, focusing on <span class=\"font-semibold\">JavaScript and React</span>. At the same time, I had the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional setting at <span class=\"font-semibold\">Abeille Assurances</span>, where I worked as a <span class=\"font-semibold\">hybrid front-end developer and web integrator</span>.",

      "p3": "Today, I have a solid core stack in <span class=\"font-semibold\">React and Next.js</span>, and I'm also familiar with <span class=\"font-semibold\">Typescript</span> and some <span class=\"font-semibold\">Angular concepts</span>. I have started looking into a couple of back-end technologies such as <span class=\"font-semibold\">Node.js and Prisma</span> in order to round out my skills and become more <span class=\"font-semibold\">full-stack</span>. I'm confident working with <span class=\"font-semibold\">JavaScript both inside and outside of frameworks</span>, building applications from scratch, manipulating the DOM directly, and structuring logic without relying on abstractions.",

      "p4": "Beyond building <span class=\"font-semibold\">scalable, reusable UI components</span>, I'm comfortable thinking in terms of <span class=\"font-semibold\">front-end architecture</span> â€” designing <span class=\"font-semibold\">modular systems</span>, managing <span class=\"font-semibold\">state predictably</span>, and ensuring <span class=\"font-semibold\">maintainability across teams</span>. I pay close attention to <span class=\"font-semibold\">accessibility</span>, <span class=\"font-semibold\">performance</span>, and <span class=\"font-semibold\">responsive design</span>, and I enjoy structuring codebases that are clean, intuitive, and easy to onboard.",

      "p5": "I'm always eager to explore <span class=\"font-semibold\">new technologies</span> and am currently seeking a <span class=\"font-semibold\">full-time position in web development</span>.",

      "p6": "<span class=\"font-semibold\">Teaching</span> taught me how to communicate complex ideas simply; <span class=\"font-semibold\">coding</span> lets me build those ideas into something tangible."
